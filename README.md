# melrose-for-vscode

This plugin is used to edit musical expressions for the [melrﾅ行e](http://github.com/emicklei/melrose) music programming tool.
Musical statements can be created with `.mel` or `.melrose` files.
Each statements can be evaluated directly with the connected `melrﾅ行e` tool, which needs to be started separately, typically in a Terminal Window.
A statement is evaluated by using the shortcut `cmd+E` and takes the content of the active line (where the cursor is), or the content of the selected text in the editor.

## Features

- direct evaluation of `melrﾅ行e` expressions using `cmd+E`
- direct play of `melrose` expressions using `cmd+3`
- loop begin `cmd+4` and loop end `cmd+5`
- stop looping and playing `cmd+k`
- inspect musial object `cmd+2`
- syntax highlighting
- visual feedback of the success of evaluation
    - flash green means OK
    - flash blue means PLAY
    - flash red means ERROR
